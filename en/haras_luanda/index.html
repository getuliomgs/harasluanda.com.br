			  <strong>The rise of a passion</strong><br />
			  <br />
			  When I was a boy, my father owned a grange in a region called Rec&ocirc;ncavo Baiano, more necessarily about 25Km far from the cities of Cachoeira e Santo Amaro da Purifica&ccedil;&atilde;o (land of Caetano Veloso and Maria Bet&acirc;nia). There were 02 crossbred horses: a tordilha mare and a sorrel horse called &ldquo;Boy&rdquo;, that was very good on trot, and therefore I loved to spend the day riding it.<br />
			  Then someday, I remember well, my father asked me:<br />
			    - You like horses a lot, don&rsquo;t you Paulo?<br />
			    Without any doubt, I answered:<br />
			    -I Love it! And someday I&rsquo;ll have a haras.<br />
			    <br />
			    <br />
		        <strong>The rise of an impassioned</strong><br />
		      <br />
		      Many difficulties came up to my life. My parents got divorced when I was 10 years old. I had to work hard since the first year at medical school. I worked hard as a book seller, I sold ozone water filters and finally I worked with importation of products from Paraguay. That was the only way to conciliate work and studies, as in the sellers area I could flexibly my time, using the weekends for the shopping trips and the free time between the classes to sell the products. By this routine, I could graduate on regular period, without fail in any subjects. In the beginning I worked in the cities of Dias D'&Aacute;vila and Cama&ccedil;ari, in the metropolitan area of Salvador. In 1992, with 20 colleagues, I founded a cooperative that became the greatest one of North and northeast and one of the greatest in Brazil.<br />
		      <br />
		      <br />
		      <strong>The birth of a dream</strong><br />
		      <br />
		      In August 2003, on the Exporural, walking on city&rsquo;s Exhibition Center, in the company of my older daughter (Thalita), I got charmed by a Pampa coat Campolina that was being ridden by a friend (then I discovered that the animal was called Jupiter do Porto Rico). I asked if the horse was for sale and the friend replied:<br />
		      - The owner won&rsquo;t sell this one, but the foal that is its descendant will be auctioned on Thursday&rsquo;s auction.<br />
		      <br />
		      Even without own any farm to house the animal, I attended to my daughter&rsquo;s request and I went to the auction to buy one of those horses. Without any friendly face, as I didn&rsquo;t know anyone who was a Campolina breeder, I couldn&rsquo;t buy Jupiter&rsquo;s foal as it was too expensive. I thought I would not buy anything, when it entered the last batch: it was the mare Pattern plating Gra&ntilde;a, a Pampa sorrel mare that I could not resist and I bought it.<br />
		      <br />
		      Then I had to find a place to house the mare. Initially I rent a bay. Later,  I bought a farm in Ara&ccedil;&aacute;s, 95 km from Salvador. The place is still the same one where Haras Luanda is located.<br />
		      <br />
		      <br />
		      <strong>When the boy&rsquo;s wish became true</strong><br />
		      <br />
		      By Fenagro, 2003, I&rsquo;ve already owned the farm when a friend known as &ldquo;Emanuel do Rato&rdquo; introduced me to Claudemiro Santana, who was a candidate for the presidencial election of Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Baiana dos Criadores de Cavalo Campolina (Bahia Association of Campolina Horses Breeders). By this time I was invited by Miro to be part of it&acute;s executive board of directors. I had some doubts as I was starting on the Campolina business, I didn&rsquo;t have much experience, but He convinced me:<br />
		      - You were born a Director, so you can&rsquo;t refuse the invitation!<br />
		      <br />
		      I did not believe that the invitation was real, so I didn&rsquo;t attend to the first meetings. Then the secretary called me, demanding my presence and I decided to try it. Thereafter it was a growing passion that took over my life, both for the wonderful breed, and for the nice people who were involved that eventually was formed a real family.<br />
		      <br />
		      And the thing got really right. The name for the Haras was a tribute to my wife, who was born in Luanda, Angola, and came to Brazil in 1975, bolted the Civil War. Then, in 2005, I went to visit the National Exhibition of the Paso Fino breed, in the United States, with Lucio Andrade. I was very impressed with what I saw and I realized I could apply some of those new practices in our ABCCC (Brazilian Association of Campolina Horse Breeders). A great example of a new practice that could be applied here was an auction of ova and semen, donated by Campolina breeders, to create a fund for implementing the breed Marketing - an idea that worked so well that resulted in a profit of more than 200 thousand Dollars.<br />
		      <br />
		      By this point, I was completely involved as a Campolina breeder. Every time I learned a bit more, I was ready to take audacious steps in invest on horses with a great genetics. Today I can say that be a horse breeder is one of the greatest motivation and pleasure in my life.<br />
